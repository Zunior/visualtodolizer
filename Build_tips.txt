I updated your build scripts to make rebuilds faster:
npm run build:apk - Fast rebuild (skips prebuild, uses existing Android project)
npm run build:apk-clean - Full rebuild (runs prebuild --clean, use when you change native config)
npm run build:apk-debug - Fast debug build
Why rebuilds are faster:
Gradle caches compiled code and dependencies
Only changed files are recompiled
The Android project structure already exists
Dependencies are already downloaded
When to use each:
Use build:apk for regular rebuilds after code changes (fast)
Use build:apk-clean only when you:
Change app.json native configuration
Add/remove Expo plugins
Need a completely fresh build
For most code changes, npm run build:apk should be much faster (2-5 minutes instead of 15-20).
