Project Goal: Build a recursive panel app for Windows (Web) and Mobile (Android/iOS).

Architecture:

Use Expo (React Native Web) and PocketBase.

The backend is at http://127.0.0.1:8090. Create a lib/pocketbase.ts client.

The Core Logic: Create a FolderView component.

It should fetch all records from the nodes collection where parent matches the current ID (or is empty for the root).

If a node is a panel, display it as an icon. Clicking it should push a new FolderView to the navigation stack.

If a node is text, open a full-screen text editor.

Styling:

Use Tailwind (NativeWind) or standard React Native Styles.

Implement a responsive grid: 2 columns on mobile, 4-6 columns on Windows.

Icons should change shape (Circle, Square, Hexagon) based on the style.shape field in the database.

Navigation: Ensure there is a "Back" button on every sub-panel.
